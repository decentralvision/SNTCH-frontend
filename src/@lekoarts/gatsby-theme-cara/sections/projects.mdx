  SNTCH actively scrapes data from all available sources and compiles it into a database of disparate nodes. SNTCH uses the uniquely identifying data from these nodes to power an algorithm which links them into comprehensive, searchable profiles.

  Using Ethereum means that reports can be stored permanently in a distributed, fault-tolerant, transparent database. This means that the records of reports made on SNTCH cannot be destroyed or edited, so reports cannot be "expunged". The design of the smart contract allows reports to be posted independent of any central authority.

  All reports made to SNTCH are completely anonymous. Identity verification is only required to participate in managing or moderating the platform. Blockchain enables anonymous payments for reporters and consumers.

  Individual reports are available to consumers for a fiat (normal money) or crypto fee. A subscription is also available. Users are paid anonymously directly to their ethereum wallet once their report is confirmed by moderators.
